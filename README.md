About the project 
this what final report should include

Students will need to perform a statistical analysis of a dataset of their choice, using any of the methods seen during the class, i.e.:

    * nonparametric estimation of survival for one or more groups
    * nonparametric comparison of 2 or more groups
    * semi-parametric Cox regression

The students have to form teams of 2 to 4 students, and submit a report, in pdf format, of maximum 10 A4 pages. Each team member will have to submit a copy of the same report.
